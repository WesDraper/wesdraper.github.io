## 1. What did you do this past week?

For starters I officially am in the class. I have been anxious about getting added to the roster mainly because I was already spending more time on this than all my other classes.  I then quickly ordered all the books from amazon, a couple have yet to get here. I also did the majority of the collatz project. The actual program has taken less time then all the overhead associated with the project however. I have gotten as far down the line as intuition and google can take me for now and I am just waiting for the next study session to get the finishing touches corrected.

I also messed around with the unit test, and code to write the unit tests. My big fear is that my code generating the tests could be wrong so I need to run it against other smarter people’s collatz.py to see if the test are valid.


## 2. What's in your way?

I only have the JavaScript book and refactoring book, didn't want to buy the books till I was added to the class. So I need to get all the other books in to finish the readings. 

I also have a few git questions/clarifications that I need to resolve. I was getting hung up on the travis build so I went ahead and did the bulk of the programing and did all my commits on the dev branch and am timid to merge even after rebasing the dev branch.  tl;dr Git proficiency is in my way.


## 3. What will you do next week?

This week I will get the finishing touches done and have the TA’s check to see if I have done the previous steps correctly as well. I need to get this done early in the week, because with the career fair coming up the job applications are going to take a big chunk of time.

## Tip-Of-The-Week

I spent a lot of time this week trying to install and update stuff only to learn that homebrew exists. To all you other mac users download homebrew, don't know why apple wouldn't build it into macs but you will need it sometime.

Grammerly. I know we CS majors are usually not known for great grammer and writting skills. Understandable when our most frequently used pucntiation is a semi-colon, the least frequently used puctiuation in any other pracice. But fear not CS people are helping CS people and have made Grammarly. Super helpful and way more insighful than a Microsoft spell check. 

Boomerang- get it. try and fake looking like a normal human, who operates durring the normal working hours or even one that wakes up early!!!

##What did you do this past week?
These past three weeks have been dominated by deadlines and recruiting. Recruitment has thrown somewhat of a wrench in my normal school schedule. Needless to say, I am looking forward to the peace that comes with having my internship locked down for the upcoming summer.

On Wednesday Ben Porter, a software developer from Main Street Hub, came to give a presentation. . It covered what a career as a software developer may look like, Main Street Hub and the recruitment process. 

I found it encouraging to see that Ben had moved around a fair amount after graduating. He had been to 4 different companies in the past 10 years. This was to hear because it addressed a stigma that we need to graduate and go to work for the company we want to retire at. It was reassuring to get to be reminded that there so still flexibility in job selection after you enter the workforce. Another thing that he mentioned, that he came to work for Main Street Hub without knowing PHP, the primary language of its code base. There is a pressure to make sure you can put the top 15 languages on you resume or else you won't find a job. So hearing Ben speak to the contrary of helped to alleviate some of that pressure. 

I also enjoyed getting to learn more about Main Street Hub. On thing that really stuck out to me was that he tried to show how to quantify  Main Street Hub's value to paying costumers. And value is always a tricky thing to put a finger on. I always love to hear how people define 'providing value' to others. The ambiguity of the phrase really allows for a person to show what they themselves value, and project that in their answers. All that to say I really appreciated how Ben defined value based on personal, anecdotal, stories first then turned to more common metrics.  I think that speaks to Main Street Hub's focus on authenticity.

Lastly, Ben's  comments on the recruiting were very helpful. He said the most important qualities for applicants are "aptitude, attitude, and collaboration." Not words per minute, "Did you build a social network for fun last week?", GPA or can you build a processor from bendy-straws, but "aptitude, attitude, and collaboration." Not to say that those other qualities don't factor in. 

##What's in your way?
One of the biggest things in the way of a smooth schedule is an irregularity of hours. Though that may seem redundant, I mean that mentally I feel more at peace with a weeks schedule that is similar to the weeks before and after it.  Constantly having to check my calendar is unsettling. It isn't necessarily business, just more the inconsistency in business.  I would benefit from a few weeks that are similar in schedule. 

##What will you do next week?
This next week I have several job interviews I need to prepare for, class projects and a hackathon in Houston. 

##Tip-Top-Tips 
I am a lover of sublime, my couch and finishing projects. For those of us that want to be able to do work on your computer on your couch. 
great vid on cs on you own machine, this vid shows a cool way to map a remote folder to your local machine. I know SFTP can let you access each file but this is a great way to have the whole folder local.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6NqBGHFfm0

The second tip, is Grammarly. I know we CS majors are usually not known for great grammar and writing skills. Understandable when our most frequently used punctuation is a semicolon, the least frequently used punctuation in any other practice. But fear not CS people are helping CS people and have made Grammarly. Super helpful and way more insightful than a Microsoft spell check.

Last tip, Boomerang- get it. It allows us crazy CS kids to try and fake looking like normal humans, who operates during the normal working hours or even ones that wake up early! You can schedule your emails to send at any time. 

p.s. I know I'm probably late to the game on Grammarly and Boomerang, but thought they were worth the share non-the-less.

As it is the last post, I am assuming that we can structure this last post however we like. 

##How did the test go?
This exam had a wide range of material to cover. Therefore, a lot of material to test our knowledge over in a confined amount of time. I felt I did a good job getting a deep understanding of all topic, but as always I came out realizingI would have rearranged my focus more after taking the test. 
I spent a lot of time focusing on topics that were less intuitive to me when we learned them in class, mainly regular expressions and relational algebra. Unfortunately, regular expressions were not on the test but luckily there were relational algebra questions. 
I was a little taken aback from the XML DTD question. I had a good understanding of how to interpret DTD's but had not practiced creating them enough. I was able to get all the right words and ordering down to make the DTD but I know I messed up some syntax. Though it may seem as a whiny student who didn't do well on one problem, I don't think it was the best use of test time to reflect students understanding. I felt I could have googled the answer, whereas the other questions required me to take SWE.  Aside from that one problem, all the rest did a good job of making us use the material we had learned applied a creative solution. 


##Reflect
In really enjoyed the first half of the class and the deep dive into python. I went from not knowing any python to it being my favorite language. The class really helped to show me a glimpse of the functionality of python and getting to use it on the project with flask and jinja, helped to reinforce the relevancy of python.
I also thoroughly enjoyed all the speakers that came to class. They were very helpful in getting a more inside look at what the life of software engineering looks like after college, the insight I had not been able to gain elsewhere. They also were helpful in learning about which tools, frameworks, and practices were most relevant in the workforces. Which I don't know if it was cherry-picked or not but coincided well with what we were learning in class. This only further increased my buy into the material we were learning. 
The first two assignments were great. They were really helpful during interviews to get to talk about with interviewers. They are simple enough to explain the problem but hard  enough that the solution seems impressive. Great Assignments.
I also loved the project. I thought it was a great team building and learning experience that mirrored real world job specs. I know you may have said it half jokingly but the comments about a manager who asks you to use or build something they don't already know how to use or build was encouraging and parallels workforce norms.
One of my favorite aspect of the course is the rhetoric you develop taking the class. during class using correct and complex vocabulary was encouraged and basically required to understand what was going on. The readings and class presentations also helped to develop a vernacular that consistent with the software development world. 
Lastly, I found the design patterns and refactoring section extremely helpful. I wish we had a chance to practice those techniques more but I understand we only have so many weeks in the class.
In conclusion, Software Engineering was an extremely enlightening and stretching class. One of my favorite classes at UT so far.

The summer gets hot, and the electricity bills goes up. Two facts of life for Texans. [Mist Box](http://www.mistbox.com/) is changing that. check out this youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOEuRcDmh48&feature=youtu.be) to see just how it works. In short it cools down the air before it is cooled down by your ac.

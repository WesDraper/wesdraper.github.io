##What did you do this past week?
This past week was a deep dive into refactoring and java. I am constantly surprised by how little I know about languages and software engineering in general. I praise Mike Scott for all I learned in 314 and 312 but there just isn't enough time. We spent a  lot of time last week dealing with overriding methods and all the variations of that, with a special focus on abstract classes. We also looked into singletons and factories, very interesting concepts.  
Downing must have been noticing the decrease in the averages in the quizzes and made last week's much more manageable. 
Our group also put a fair amount of time into the phase three of the IDB. We had the most difficulty with the search functionality. This was mainly self-inflicted because we pursued four different ways to implement that functionality. 


##What's in your way?
This week we will be finishing up the presentation and presenting on Wednesday, which is nice to be able to get the presentation over with before buckling down for the test prep. 
I also have a Data Managment project to present Thursday, and it is using some very interesting tools that were created by our professor. This makes it very hard to look up error's that we encounter. 


##What will you do next week?
This next week  I will have to start studying for the test and getting the cheat ready. I have an algorithms test on Wednesday which requires a fair amount of studying as well. But that is the nature of the last few weeks of school. 


##Tip of the Week
A couple of cool new products out there I thought were worth sharing.

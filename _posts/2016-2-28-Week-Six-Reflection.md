#What did you do this past week?
We learned a lot about argument passing and argument declaration. I even got to implement what we had learned in a interview this week. It is helpful to show off your understanding of nuances of languages, I definitely earned some brownie point for it. We also had Conrad Stroll from Mutual Mobile come talk to us mainly focusing on open source software and frameworks. His talk address: what can we do with open source, how to use it,  how to contribute and why to contribute. I found his approach to contribution really practical, "If you solve the same problem on different projects it is probably a viable candidate for open source." Likewise, if you if it is a candidate for open source than more than likely it already is. 

##What's in your way?
I have quite a few other time commitments this week that are going to get in the way of studying for this upcoming test. The largest being that I have to go to Dallas Tuesday and Wednesday for an office visit and interview. It might be bad to admit to missing class but you got to break a few eggs to make an omelet, hopefully, this omelet decides to employ a truant So handling them as efficiently as possible is going to be pivotal to the success of this week.

##What will you do next week?
This next week is the test, so that will pretty much consume my week. I plan on just going through the list of topics, creating a brief summary explaining and then write 3 questions based on that topic with answers. I have found that thinking through how to write questions helps to prepare me well for answering questions. I also will go back through all the quizzes and make sure I fully understand all the answers and why they are correct.

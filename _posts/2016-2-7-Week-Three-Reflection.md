## 1. What did you do this past week?

This past week I finished collatz program. Unfortunately I also had 3 interviews, two career fairs and an assignment due in every of my classes due last week as well. I did my best to prep for the storm, the week and weekend before but it was a long week. 

I do have to give credit where credit is due, at the career fairs mentioning Downing’s class was a big help. Many of the recruiters were UT cs alumni, and knew of Downing’s class. And I got to talk about unitTesting several times with recruiters. 

## 2. What's in your way?

I am still behind in a couple classes and in other extracurricular engagements. So I’m hopping to catch up this week to get back on pace or else these issue are going to keep compounding. 

## 3. What will you do next week?

I hope to knock out a big chunk of Netflix so that the last week of the project is just time to ask clarifying questions about the project spec. I waiting till the last day to submit the project was way more stress than I need to deal with, so time to asks questions will be much appreciated. 

## Tip-Of-The-Week

So by the looks of it we are going to be in python for a while, and the quizzes will continue to cover python concepts.  I would encourage you to take a little time and learn the language in more depth. so fun fact UT offers free access to Lynda an awesome tutorial site.  This is the link to a very comprehensive set of tutorials of python: http://www.lynda.com/Python-3-tutorials/essential-training/62226-2.html
Well worth the watch, especially in recruiting season and heaven forbid an interviewer asks you to code in python because you put it on your resume

##What did you do this past week?
On Monday we finished the last lecture of SWE, going over code patterns. though I am happy to not be failing any more quizzes I am sad to have ended the lectures. On Wednesday, our group was the first to present. It did take a little persuading but I convinced our group  to run through the presentation the night before. Many were in the "just wing it" camp. The practice definitely paid off. I thought our group did a great job of presenting, and finished on time. Friday was also more presentations. Overall the presentations have been good, but it is easy to see when a group hasn't done a practice run when they get up there. That being sad us CS kids aren't exactly known to be great public speakers. I think having to present in front of the class our peers is very helpful for a lot of CS kids, who haven't had to do much public speaking before. If you are going to excel in the real world you have to be able to speak about your ideas and projects in an effective manner. It also helps to get to talk to a class full of students who all have done the same thing as you and are able to understand the main points without much work on your own part.


##What's in your way?
Exam! This week is make or break it for me. I have an exam in both algorithms and SWE and need to do well on both. 

##What will you do next week?
Study! The material for this exam is much more diverse which will require a much more focused study plan to master all the material. I will also have to be much more systematic about my cheatsheet. Being able to read through it quickly and having the right information on there is going to crucial during the test.

##Tip of the Week
Alright Alright, tip-of-the-week time. Make sure to start stud..  just kidding everyone else has that tip on lock. Here are a couple cool new products you should know about. 
[Register to Vote](https://registertovote.us/) is an app that can register you to vote simply by taking a picture of your driver's license. Which is totally awesome except for the fact that is currently only supported in California, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Arizona, Colorado, and Massachusetts. But none the less, still a really cool app idea that provides a benefit to society, sorry flappy bird. 
In the same vane, go out and vote for [Proposition 1](http://www.voteprop1.com/) to keep ridesharing in Austin. Check out the get the facts page to see why you should. It is so simple just walk into the FAC before May 3rd for early voting. There is hardly ever a line during early voting.

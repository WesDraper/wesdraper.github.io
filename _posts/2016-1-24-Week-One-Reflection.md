First week of the semester varies a lot across campus. It takes living with students from another college to get to see those differences play out.  Many other college’s commonly refer to this week as “chillabus week” due to the light workload that accompanies this week. Now I don't intend to try and sound like the typical CS “my life is harder than yours” kid that everyone hates, but the professors of the CS department have yet to be told to adhere to the unspoken rule of “chillabus week.” However if you have lived at 2317 Speedway, long enough you have grown to expect to hit the ground running, or sprinting depending on when your first 439 project is due, God bless your soul. If you’ve toughed it out long enough, or cried quietly enough in my case, you get the pleasure of tormenting your social life again by taking one of Downing’s classes. 

I am currently auditing Software Engineer with the hopes of getting to “late add” into it. I’ve been told that if I want to actually learn the skills that employers want to see on a resume, Downing is one of the few professors that equip you with them. These first two class periods have confirmed the legend.  We spend a little time looking at an outline of the class then quickly move into an intro to python. Downing is constantly engaging the class by calling off the role to ask questions about the code as we walkthrough it as a class. When someone raises their hand they have to first say their name. In doing so, helping to make a packed 60+ person class feel more personable. It isn’t until I get back home then the workload of this class starts to hit home as I look at the 37 steps and 20+ sup-steps for the project due next week. 

Which brings me to my tip-of-the-week: Start letting your roommates know not to file a missing persons report this semester if they don't see you. And like every professor you’ve had so far “start early.”

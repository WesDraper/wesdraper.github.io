##What did you do this past week?
Last week was test prep galore.  I had a fair amount of reading to catch up on and I went out of town to some onsite interviews Tuesday and Wednesday which interrupted my normal test prep schedule, though they did pay off in getting the offer. But anyways I had a good amount of XP to catch up on but it worked out really well because in my interviews I asked questions about story development and the developers were impressed because they hadn't heard the term till they had started working. Great way to look smart, without having to be smart. I also had to submit answers to a coding problem for an application and submitting my answer with the unit tests I wrote to go with the solution also really helped me impress the recruiters. The problem was pretty straightforward so that makes it hard to differentiate yourself from the other applicants. So submitting some good unittest goes a long way.
Anyways for prepping for the test the reading were important and making sure I could summarize each theme on the topics list. I also went through all the class example .py files and removed all the right side of the assert statements and made sure the file would execute. 
After taking the test I think I focused too much on details not enough time making sure I could fit them all together.

##What's in your way?
I need to get a good team together for the upcoming idb website, after a semester in OS, you learn to appreciate good teammates. 

##What will you do next week?
This week I am going to finish up an EDX course on Mean Stack, to get ready for the idb project. And try to get a head start in phase 1, before spring break. 

##Tip-Top-Tips 
For those of you new to the web-dev sphere, like me, I have started looking into MEAN Stack development. It is not the same tech stack as we will be using for the idb assignment but it does have similar parts and does demystify the big picture idea of how to roadmap this project. Here is a [link](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MongoDBx+M101x+3T2015/info) to an edx class that I am doing to get a handle on this, that you follow along doing a project for. BTW I would think this would qualify as a non-scholastic project, that you could put in your selio.

##What did you do this past week?
this past week we went through some more SQL operations. and started going through the refactoring book as well. Did much better on the quizzes this week, which was much needed. I really enjoyed going through the refactoring exercises. The author does a great job at taking a jumbled mess of code and breaking down into very succinct components.  Each aspect that he changes both has a purpose in the scheme but also is small enough. This makes it very easy to follow along and understand each decision. 

##What's in your way?
We have been doing really well on the first two phases of the project and this has put us in a good spot for the last leg. I think one of the largest things in our way for this leg, however, is fear of Carina. Most  of the stories that we want to implement for this phase of the project are frontend focused. Unfortunately, we frontenders are timid about implementing changes that could break the build set up.  So just clarifying weak points of our setup and knowing how to make sure and implement changes for the stories that do not prove to  be a problem for carina.

##What will you do next week?
So this next week will be mostly finishing up the third phases and putting together our presentation. 

##Tip of the Week

I'm all about the chrome extensions, some of them are extremely practical others are more fun focused. I think this one falls somewhere in the middle [Git Random](https://github.com/Idnan/git-random) replaces new tab with random GitHub user's profile. A fun way to see others in the developer community and see what people are working on around the world. 

Another tip, those of you who are entrepreneurial, and might be working on a startup. If you want a lighthearted way to ask some serious questions about your startup you should check [this](http://proto.dheera.net/yc/) out.

##What did you do this past week?
In class, we learned a lot of SQL and table operations. Luckily most of the SQL statements for the IDB project are handled through SQLAlchemy. Now that our project had a filled database I got to really experience how helpful SQLAlchemy. I was in charge of the templating of our website. So I interacted a lot with the models and app.py to send the correct tables to each page. SQLAlchemy was most helpful in its ability to keep my functions short and readable. I also fell in love with the simplicity of Jinja templating. One of the most powerful attributes of jinja is it's template inheritance . Template inheritance allows you to build a base “skeleton” template that contains all the common elements of your site and defines blocks that child templates can override. We implemented this by creating a layout.html file, that included all the header, navbar and footer information. This helped a lot when  we made changes to CSS or JS files and only had to edit the layout page.
Another handy feature of Jinja is its ability to include logic in the template. Though it is a good rule of thumb to minimize the logic in a template, jinja does allow some basic expressions. This keeps the template engine easier to maintain and templates more readable. 
So it seemed that the week went well we had the site fully functional on our virtual box Wednesday night, and when we met Thursday mid afternoon we though it would be very brief. We were wrong. Our team had one guy in charge of the Docker side of the project but by 4am Thursday night, we had 4 of us.  I think we attempted every possible way to jerry-rig that website up. Each one of us taking a slightly different approach hoping it would work, going so far as to start learning Postgres at midnight to start  re-implementing the website with that instead of MySQL. I couldn't even tell you what the problem was now, but it works and that's all I care about. Certainly scared me enough to appreciate all backends everywhere, the true heroes.

##What's in your way?
 Well I certainly shot myself in the foot with quizzes last week, they were much more detail oriented than the previous one and I don't think I was awake for more than 20 minutes before I took each one. so this week I will certainly allow for my brain to wake up more before taking the quizzes. 
##What will you do next week?
We are trying to shoot for finishing part 3 this week, for several reasons. First and foremost being the nightmare that happened last Thursday. Second is everyone's schedule is lighter this week. And third  because our design sensei, @Julie, could use the week to really get the colors and styling the way she likes. Without having to worry about messing up the functionality.

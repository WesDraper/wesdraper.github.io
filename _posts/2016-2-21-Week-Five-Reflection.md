#What did you do this past week?
This past week was a heavy focus on generators. This is a pretty complex part of python, and extremely nuanced. I found that the best way to go about understanding how generators work across different data structures is by making sure to understand those data structures. Memorizing is not going to be the right approach. 
We also finished up Netflix. This project was much less algorithm intense and more technology intensive.  Our main prediction algorithm was just one line, but to get there took a lot of setup and trial and error in setting up our pickles

##What's in your way?
These next two weeks I need to really focus on getting a  strong depth in the data structures and all their nuances to prepare for the test coming up. I am lacking a good foundation which is making more complex aspects of the language much harder to understand. 

##What will you do next week?
I will go about making sure I understand the data structures well. Also I will use this time to catch up on readings that I have missed. Luckily for me, I have several test this week that I can get out of the way, and will be less distracted next week when I really need to hunker down to prep for the test

##Tip-Top-Tips 
We spend so much time in our code editor's. It is important to invest time to learn the best hot-keys. We want the experience of programming to be as seamless as possible, by ingraining the hot-keys you are more efficient in communicating your ideas to the computer. Not to mention you look B.A. when you casual hit a hot-key when pair-programming. Make yourself look like a better programmer than you are, learn the hot-keys. 

We have a free access to Lynda check my previous [tip of the week](http://wesdraper.github.io/Week-Three-Reflection/), this [series](http://www.lynda.com/Sublime-Text-tutorials/Up-Running-Sublime-Text-2/114325-2.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=l1-US-Search-Web-Up%2Band%2BRunning%2Bwith%2BSublime%2BText%2B2&cid=l1-us:en:ps:lp:prosc:s88:1526:all:google:mbm-sublime_tutorial&utm_content=65287004826&utm_term=%2Bsublime%20%2Btutorial&device=c&gclid=CjwKEAiA3aW2BRCD_cOo5oCFuUMSJADiIMILGj_USO_WTxQGorpPJ6Pua57MzJ-y3YsYdzf8O9OBkhoCkH_w_wcB) is really useful in being an efficient sublimer.

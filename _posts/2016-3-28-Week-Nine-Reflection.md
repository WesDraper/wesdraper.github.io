##What did you do this past week?
This past week was the first week of the IMDB project. So a majority of the week was focused on establishing a team and then choosing a good topic. One thing that our team want to make sure to do was to choose a topic that had good API's for the topic. We know that this project is going to be very tough, especially given our teams limited exposure the tools used in this project,  we did not want the database content to be our limiting factor.

We also had a presentation from a Rackspace engineer, Everett Toews, come explain one of the tools we would be using for this project Docker and Carina. Docker is the new answer to Virtual Machines. Everett walked us through a brief overview of what Docker is. Docker is revolved around this idea of containers which is an isolated space on a machine for the user to run its processes, similar to VM. However what makes docker great is that" Containers, however, use shared operating systems. That means they are much more efficient than hypervisors in system resource terms. Instead of virtualizing hardware, containers rest on top of a single Linux instance. This in turn means you can “leave behind the useless 99.9% VM junk, leaving you with a small, neat capsule containing your application,” said  [James Bottomley](http://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/)

##What's in your way?
This week our group is scattered for spring break. I am actually in Arizona and going to be camping for the majority of the week. So the biggest thing in our way is parsing the work and making sure week are on track. 

##What will you do next week?
This week I will be backpacking and camping at the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park. Then I will be getting back and cramming to get up to speed on the project

##Tip-Top-Tips 
You're only young once. Make sure you don't say youth is wasted on the young. Go explore and be outside. We can work on computers until we are old and grey but our legs and free time is only here for a short will. So make a list of places you really want to see or go and then start checking off the list.
